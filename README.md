iOS Engineer Task
=====================

The fundamental basis of any squad, is a team of kick-ass superheroes. Hence this task,
**The Superhero Squad Maker.** Your mission is to build the ultimate superhero squad using
the [Marvel API](https://developer.marvel.com) for data.

The app is simple. When opened, it shows your current squad at the top (if any) and a list of all characters from the Marvel API. Keep in mind the API does not return all characters in a single batch.

Tapping on a character shows details and gives you option to recruit to or fire from a squad.
